## 🧩 Problem Statement

## **The Challenge of Manual Literature Reviews**

Academic research and professional knowledge work rely heavily on comprehensive literature reviews.  
However, the traditional manual process presents significant challenges:

---

### **⏱ Time Investment**

A thorough literature review typically requires **40–80 hours** of researcher time, involving:

- Searching across multiple databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, arXiv)  
- Reading and summarizing 20–50+ papers  
- Identifying thematic patterns manually  
- Cross-referencing methodologies and findings  
- Synthesizing insights across diverse sources  
- Formatting citations and references  

---

### **⚠️ Quality Inconsistencies**

Manual reviews are susceptible to:

- **Confirmation bias** (favoring papers supporting existing hypotheses)  
- **Coverage gaps** (limited by search skills and database access)  
- **Incomplete synthesis** (difficult to spot subtle cross-paper patterns)  
- **Citation errors & formatting inconsistencies**  

---

### **🚧 Accessibility Barriers**

Not everyone has equal access to:

- Expensive academic database subscriptions  
- Time to conduct thorough reviews  
- Training in systematic review methodologies  
- Tools for managing large volumes of research  

---

## **Agents for Good: Democratizing Research**

This project addresses the **Agents for Good** challenge by creating an AI-driven research assistant that:

### 1. **Democratizes Access**  
Allows students, independent researchers, and professionals in developing regions to conduct high-quality literature reviews **without costly subscriptions or specialized expertise**.

### 2. **Accelerates Discovery**  
Reduces hours of mechanical effort (searching, summarizing, formatting) so researchers can focus on **innovation**, **hypothesis-building**, and **analysis**.

### 3. **Improves Quality**  
Ensures consistent, unbiased, and comprehensive analysis—eliminating human cognitive limitations.

### 4. **Levels the Playing Field**  
Gives smaller institutions the same analytical capabilities enjoyed by well-funded universities.

---

### **❗ Why This System Is Needed**

A system is required that:

- Automates the mechanical aspects of literature review  
- Maintains academic rigor  
- Reduces time and effort  
- Makes quality research accessible to all  

**Mukti Scholar delivers this capability at scale.**
